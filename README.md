# Opal (version: 0.9.1)

Opal is a type inferred language that aims to be expressive and comfortable to use.

See the [SYNTAX.md](syntax run-down) for a basic Opal reference.

### Goals
* Powerful, expressive and safe type inference system
* Simple syntax
* Relatively fast runtime

### Todo
* Expand standard library
* Compiler optimizations

### Note
* Opal has been compiled and tested in cygwin using `g++` (version 4.9.3) and `clang++` (version 3.5.2). It is not confirmed to be stable with mingw
