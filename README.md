# Opal
Opal is a type inferred language that aims to be comfortable to use with clear syntax.

### Goal
* Powerful type system
* Simple syntax (without mandatory semicolons)
* Relatively fast runtime (no boxed floating point numbers)

## TODO
* Expand standard library a little
* Compiler optimizations (tail calls especially)
* Exception throwing/catching syntax
* JIT compilation?

## NOTICE
* I have fixed the source code so that it successfully compiles with `g++` as well as `clang++`
* However, compiling with `mingw32-g++` gives very strange error messages, which I will be soon looking into

### Version
Version 0.9.0
