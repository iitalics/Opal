# Opal
Opal is a type inferred language that aims to be comfortable to use with clear syntax.

### Goal
* Powerful type system
* Simple syntax (without mandatory semicolons)
* Relatively fast runtime (no boxed floating point numbers)

## TODO
* A few things

## NOTICE
* Opal is being compiled with `clang` and doesn't work with `g++` due to `g++` blantantly not implemented features of the C standard in their C++ compiler
* Due to the above, I'm not sure if it works in a native windows environment, as I am currently building it in Cygwin

### Version
Version 0.0.1
